            <br>Dear Eileen,<br>
            <br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
            <br>of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>

      <h2 class="h2"><b>Starting Dates</b></h2>
    </header>
      
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        <br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        <br>
        <br>You can find more information about <a href="url">important university dates</a> on our website.

        Subjects of study
      </h3>
    </header>
      
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall 
        <br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
        <br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
        <br>by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
        <br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the 
        <br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

      <h4 class="h2">Exotic Dance Moves</h4>
    </header>
      
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, 
      <br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
      <br>
      <dl>
      <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</dd>
      <dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
      <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
      <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
      <dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</dd>
      <dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
      <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
      <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
      <dd>discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd> 
      <dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
      <dd>because they were really cold.</dd>
      </dl>
      <br>For more of my research, see my <a href="url">exotic dance research page</a>.
      <br>
      <br>Yours sincerely,
      <br>
